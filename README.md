# Exploratory Data Analysis on CVD Risk Dataset
This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project using a dataset related to Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Risk. I used the CVD dataset from Kaggle, which can be accessed through the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jocelyndumlao/cair-cvd-2025-cardiovascular-risk-from-bangladesh. This dataset comprises 1,529 patient samples collected from Jamalpur Medical College Hospital, Jamalpur, Bangladesh, from January 20, 2024, to January 1, 2025. 

The dataset includes a wide range of variables critical for CVD risk estimation, including basic demographic information, anthropometric measurements, clinical values, biochemical markers, and lifestyle factors. These variables are crucial for identifying risk factors, understanding disease progression, and developing preventive health strategies.

The goal of this analysis is to gain insights into the features that may influence the likelihood of developing cardiovascular disease, by using visualizations, summary statistics, and data-cleaning techniques.

**Goals**
1. Understand the structure and quality of the data
2. Detect missing values, duplicates, and outliers
3. Analyze the distribution of key variables
4. Explore relationships between features and CVD outcome
5. Prepare data for further statistical modeling or machine learning
